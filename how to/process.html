<p>Developing your film is easy. Remember film is light sensitive. You need to keep it in complete darkness until the end. We'll begin with the changing bag. If this is your first time - you'll be working in the changing bag so you won't be able to actually see what you are doing. I recommend you get some used film on eBay and practice without the bag a few times until you can do it with your eyes closed - or in the bag. Its not hard, but get a feel for it.<br>
<br>
It might be also important to note that its very possible you'll mess up the first time. Don't get discouraged! Practice a bit first then give it a try. Get some cheap film that you can ruin trying to learn. Its okay.
<br><br>
Once you've figured out how to get the film on to the reel. You're ready to go. Put everything you need into the changing bag. Get your film on the reel and get the reel into the developing canister. Then you're ready to rock.
<br><br>
Finally I'll go ahead and put either tap water or distilled water into the can to pre-soak the film. This is optional and not critical. I just do it because its part of my process - do it or don't. Remember though, stay consistent. <br>
